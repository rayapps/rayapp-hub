<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="meta">PixelCatch &nbsp;·&nbsp; Last updated: February 23, 2026</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>PixelCatch is a screen capture and annotation app for macOS. We take your privacy seriously. This policy explains what data the app accesses and exactly what we do with it.</p>

<h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>PixelCatch does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No account or registration required</li>
  <li>No analytics or crash reporting sent to any server</li>
  <li>No advertising identifiers used</li>
  <li>No usage data collected</li>
  <li>No screenshots or images are ever uploaded or transmitted</li>
</ul>

<h2>Screen Recording Permission</h2>
<p>PixelCatch requests macOS Screen Recording permission solely to capture your screen. All captured images are processed entirely on your device and are never sent anywhere. You control where each image is saved.</p>

<h2>In-App Purchase</h2>
<p>The optional Pro upgrade is processed entirely by Apple through the Mac App Store. We do not receive or store any payment information. Apple's privacy policy governs that transaction.</p>

<h2>Local Storage</h2>
<p>Your preferences (such as default save location, hotkeys, and language) are stored locally on your Mac using <code>UserDefaults</code>. This data never leaves your device.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>PixelCatch does not integrate any third-party SDKs, analytics services, or advertising networks.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>PixelCatch does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted at <a href="https://rayapp.cc/pixelCatch/privacy">rayapp.cc/pixelCatch/privacy</a> with a revised date.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can reach us via the <a href="https://github.com/ray1888/PixelCatch">PixelCatch GitHub page</a>.</p>
